# CS336-Final-Project
This is my final project for my Principles of Info and Data Management class. It was developed in collaboration with two other classmates (whose names will be omitted from this readme due to privacy reasons).

The project simulates a rideshare system (think Uber) within the confines of the Rutgers New Brunswick campus. Students can give or receive rides. There are three types of users:

* Administrators
* End-users
* System-support staff

This project is written using Java Server Pages (JSP). The data is stored on a MySQL database. The website is hosted on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) server.
