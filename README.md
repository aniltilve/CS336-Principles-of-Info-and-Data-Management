# CS336-Final-Project
This is my final project for my Principles of Info and Data Management class. It was developed in collaboration with two other classmates (whose names will be omitted from this readme for privacy reasons).

## Project Description

The project simulates a rideshare system (think Uber) within the confines of the Rutgers New Brunswick campus. University students serve as the hypothetical users of this rideshare system. The three types of users, and their uses of the system are listed below:

* Administrators: creates new system-support staff accounts and runs queries for end-user ride statistics
* End-users: give and receive rides, communicate with other end-users via a built-in messaging system, and rate other end-users upon ride completion
* System-support staff: Reset passwords for end-users, lock out misbehaving end-users, add in-ride advertisements, and generate statics for these advertisements.

## Project Implementation

This project is written using Java Server Pages (JSP). The data is stored on a MySQL database. The website is hosted on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) server.
